# Improve performance removing the spread operator

This project is the code of my [Youtube Video]() about how to improve performance removing the spread operator

## API project

This project is a fake API to get the list of cats. It uses [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to create a fake API.

1. cd `db`
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
4. Wait until it says `JSON Server is running on port 3000`
5. Open [http://localhost:3000/cats?\_page=1&\_limit=100](http://localhost:3000/cats?_page=1&_limit=100) to check if it works

## Web project

This project is a web app with typescript to show the approach to improve performance without spread operator

1. cd `web`
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Open [http://127.0.0.1:5173/](http://127.0.0.1:5173/)
